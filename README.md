## The NEAR Ecommerce Solution for Global Online Merchants 

![world](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69501009/201518424-3ac8b9de-a826-4318-a6c7-84fb17cf1d82.svg)

##### <u>The Status Quo</u>

WooCommerce is an open-source eCommerce plugin for WordPress, which is a popular CMS that has a whooping global market share of 43%. It is designed for small to large-sized online merchants using WordPress. Currently, we do not have a comprehensive blockchain solution for eCommerce which allow business owners to fully implement blockchain-powered features (such as product & stock management, payment gateway, accounting task, etc) for their online merchant. Moreover, we also required the solution to be designed in a way that even a non-tech person can easily set it up (AKA user-friendly) to reduce the cost of hiring a professional tech team to maintain the operation at the back. 

##### <u>The Solution</u>

For the NEAR MetaBUILD Hackathon III, I am going to introduce **NEAR for WooCommerce. It is NEAR Protocolâ€™s first open-source eCommerce engine & payment solution for WooCommerce, providing comprehensive NEAR eCommerce solutions for everyone**. Now, online merchant owners just have to download and install it to their online store admin panel, and they are ready to integrate NEAR into their online eCommerce business. Plus, NEAR for WooCommerce is designed in a way where it can easily help online merchants to onboard their current Web2.0 customer base into Web3.0. 

##### <u>The Potential</u>

Imagine all the WooCommerce online stores around the world which still use traditional Web2.0 eCommerce management tools, bringing the NEAR for WooCommerce to their online business. It is a big paradigm shift from traditional online eCommerce to blockchain-powered online eCommerce, forming a huge network of NEAR-commerce stores! Plus, this will further increase the adoption of NEAR all around the world, as everyone now can use their NEAR wallet and NEAR â“ƒ in those online eCommerce stores, as well as have a unique NEAR shopping experience.

**So, how powerful is NEAR for WooCommerce?** ðŸ‘‡
